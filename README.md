# Tesla Token Generator

Thanks for visiting this project. I put this together because I didn't trust putting sensitive Tesla data into unfamiliar webpages. Use at your own risk!


## What does it do?
It generates your Tesla Access and Refresh tokens for use with things like Teslamate.


## How do I use it?

Make sure you have python installed on your machine and run the tesla.py file. You then have to navigte to the generated response url, log in to your Tesla account, and copy the authorization code generated from that (it will be in the resulting url).
Paste it into the prompt an hit enter. Your Access and Refresh token will be printed in the console. Store them in a secure location and DO NOT SHARE THEM.
